# botic
Free, open-source, extendable crypto trading bot.

Botic can integrate with multiple exchanges and use different trading algorithms. The current
state only has a few available, but more will come in the future.

# DISCLAIMER

This software is for educational purposes only. Do not risk money which you are afraid to lose. USE
THE SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE AUTHORS AND ALL AFFILIATES ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR
TRADING RESULTS.

# Install

It is highly recommended to setup a virtualenv before installing. Example:

```
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```
## PyPI

```
pip install botic
```

## setup.py

```
python setup.py install
```

# Running

## Directory Setup

To get started, in your project's directory it is recommended to create a few directories:
1. `cache` - stores state files to track orders
2. `log` - log data
3. `config` - store configuration files

Example:
```
mkdir cache log config
```

## Configuration
Copy the [example.conf](/example.conf) to the `config/` directory. The recommendation is to name it after the
currency (e.g. `BTC-USD` would be `config/btc.conf`)

```
[exchange]
exchange_module = CoinbasePro
key = abc
passphrase = xyz
b64secret = 123

[general]
coin = BTC-USD
sleep_seconds = 60
log_file = log/btc.log
cache_file = cache/btc.cache
pause_file = bot.pause

[trader]
trader_module = Simple
max_outstanding_sells = 10
max_buys_per_hour = 10
sell_target = 1.25
buy_barrier = 0.5
buy_percent = 1.0
buy_max = 150.00
buy_min = 35.00
stoploss_enable = no
stoploss_percent = -7.0
stoploss_seconds = 86400
stoploss_strategy = report

[notify]
mail_host = mail.example.com
mail_from = from@example.com
mail_to = to@example.com, other@example.com
notify_only_sold = True
```

## Trading

To start the bot, two commands exist:
1. `botic` - start the bot with specified config
2. `boticp` - wraps `botic` in a loop in case of error (restarts on failure)

Example:
```
boticp config/btc.conf
```

# Top Command

```
botictop
```

# Backtesting
To test out different trader modules/algorithms, there is a drop-in
[backtest exchange](/botic/exchange/backtest.py) that provides historical CoinbasePro BTC-USD data.
To use, set your config to `exchange_module = Backtest`.

# Adding an Exchange

Exchanges modules are stored in [botic/exchange](/botic/exchange). To add another exchange,
copy the base template class and implement the abstract methods. Example:

```
cp -nv botic/exchange/base.py botic/exchange/EXCHANGE_NAME.py
edit botic/exchange/EXCHANGE_NAME.py
```

NOTE: The template base class will likely change or be clarified more in the next few releases.

# Adding a Trader

Trader modules are stored in [botic/trader](/botic/trader). To add another trader,
copy the base template class and implement the abstract methods. Example:

```
cp -nv botic/trader/base.py botic/trader/TRADER_NAME.py
edit botic/trader/TRADER_NAME.py
```

NOTE: The template base class will likely change or be clarified more in the next few releases.
